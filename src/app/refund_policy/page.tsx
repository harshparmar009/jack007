            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">1. No Refund Policy Overview</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              JackInfoSoft IT Solutions does not offer refunds for any services rendered, including but not limited to IT consulting, software development, web design, system integration, managed IT services, and other related services. Once payment is made for any service, it is non-refundable, regardless of the stage of project completion, nature of the service, or whether the service has been partially or fully delivered.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">2. Service Delivery & Performance</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              We ensure that our services are delivered in accordance with the specifications, timelines, and standards agreed upon in the contract or service agreement. We strive to maintain the highest quality and meet the expectations set forth. If there are concerns or dissatisfaction with our work, we encourage clients to reach out to us immediately so that we can address the issue and make the necessary adjustments.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">3. Custom Solutions & Development</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              For custom IT solutions, software development, or any tailor-made services, we invest significant time and resources in research, design, and development. As such, no refund will be issued once work has commenced, including when initial drafts or prototypes are delivered or when the development process is in progress.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">4. Service Modifications</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              If modifications or changes are requested after the initiation of a project or service, the client will be required to cover the cost of the additional work. We encourage open communication during the project planning stages to ensure the final product meets expectations, reducing the need for extensive changes after delivery.

          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">5. Cancellations</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              Once a service agreement is signed or payment is made, cancellation of the agreement does not entitle the client to a refund. Cancellations may, however, be subject to an adjustment or a partial credit for future services, depending on the stage of the project and any work already completed at the time of cancellation.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">6. Client Responsibilities</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              It is the clientâ€™s responsibility to ensure that all project requirements, specifications, and expectations are clearly communicated before the service begins. Once an agreement is made, any subsequent requests or revisions outside of the initial scope will be handled as additional services with associated costs.
